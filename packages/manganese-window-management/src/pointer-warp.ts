//
// The rule: the pointer moves only when it will not be over the newly focused
// window once the layout settles. Every focus change `usePointerWarp` answers
// goes through `warpTo`, which hands the engine that window's frame: the page
// cannot see the pointer move over a browser window's page, so the engine,
// which can, makes the check. See
// packages/manganese-window-management/docs/WINDOW-MANAGEMENT.md#pointer-warping.
